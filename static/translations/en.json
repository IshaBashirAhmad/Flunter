    "home-question-section-header-helping-line-2": "We are here to entertain your queries and to solve your problems.",
    "home-question-section-question-1": "What is the Flunter application used for?",
    "home-question-section-answer-1": "The application is used to search for candidates or prospects based on keywords (such as technology names or company functions) and a location. Over the years, Flunter has accumulated millions of data points that allow the application to replace all other hunting tools for prospecting and recruitment.",
    "home-question-section-question-2": "What type of companies is Flunter for?",
    "home-question-section-answer-2": "All companies whose employees or clients are IT profiles. The list is therefore very long and varied but includes IT Service Companies, Software Publishers, IT Recruitment Agencies, Tech Startups, Web and Mobile Development Agencies, Prospecting Agencies, Cloud Service Providers, IT Consulting Firms, IT Integrators, Cybersecurity Solution Providers, IT Equipment Suppliers, Telecom Operators, Data Management Service Providers, IT Freelancers, Digital Marketing Agencies, etc. More broadly, any company that has sales and/or recruitment teams addressing IT candidates or prospects has every interest in using Flunter to significantly accelerate their development.",
    "home-question-section-question-3": "Why does the Flunter application alone replace my prospecting and recruitment aid tools?",
    "home-question-section-answer-3": "Simply because it is the largest database available on the IT market (email addresses, mobile phone numbers, etc.). Moreover, and most importantly, the Flunter application has been designed and conceived in such a way that it can provide 5 to 10 times more targeted results than other tools in the sector. The data has been filtered, processed, and refined in advance by specialized teams, so you have perfectly targeted results, which saves you a lot of time and increases efficiency. More than 91% of the data on Flunter is up-to-date, correct, and targeted. Finally, unlike most tools, Flunter allows you to find both candidates and prospects (not one or the other) with the same quality and efficiency. You can therefore centralize and rationalize your tools for sales and recruitment teams.",
    "home-question-section-question-4": "How can I get trained on using Flunter?",
    "home-question-section-answer-4": "Flunter is so easy to use and has been designed in such a way that any novice can use the platform in no time. However, there is documentation available in the 'Resources' section.",
    "home-question-section-question-5": "How do subscriptions work?",
    "home-question-section-answer-5": "Subscriptions are either monthly or annual. Each subscription level gives you a number of credits, a number of users, and a number of simultaneous connections. Once subscribed, you can then search unlimitedly on the Flunter application. However, each time you want to obtain contact details, you will need to use credits.",
    "home-question-section-question-6": "How do credits work?",
    "home-question-section-answer-6": "Credits are used to unlock access to the contact details of people who match your search. A mobile phone number, for example, requires 10 credits, while a professional email address requires 1 credit. Unused credits in a month are carried over to the next month.",
    "home-question-section-question-7": "Can we get even more credits and users?",
    "home-question-section-answer-7": "You can indeed have access to a customized offer. To do so, please contact our sales teams by email at ssddssqdqsddqs@sdfsdsfd. One of our experts will get back to you within 72 hours to offer you an offer tailored to your expectations and needs.",
    "home-question-section-question-8": "Can I cancel at any time?",
    "home-question-section-answer-8": "After that, the cancellation terms will depend on the type of subscription you have chosen and the specific conditions related to it. In many cases, we have found that fourteen days are enough for our clients to recoup a year's subscription to Platinum.",
    "home-question-section-question-9": "What return on investment can I expect from using Flunter?",
    "home-question-section-answer-9": "In the IT market, we know that on average a converted candidate or prospect equals an average of 18,000 euros of margin generated. That's precisely why the Gold subscription price is €1,500 per month. Indeed, statistics from the last 3 years allow us to say that more than 87% of our users fall into the '8 and more' range. This means that more than 87% of our clients convert 8 or more candidates and/or prospects per year of using Flunter. If we assume that a converted candidate or prospect equals €18,000 in margin generated, then more than 87% of our clients generate at least 18,000 x 8, or at least €144,000 over 12 months of using the platform. This is a return on investment of over 800% per year.",
    "home-question-section-question-10": "How do you guarantee the confidentiality of my searches?",
    "home-question-section-answer-10": "Data protection is not only one of our priorities, it is THE priority. Therefore, we implement rigorous security measures to protect your data and ensure the confidentiality of your searches. All data transmitted is encrypted using cutting-edge protocols. Your information is stored on secure servers with advanced encryption. We employ authentication methods and strict access controls to ensure that only authorized persons can access the data. Our systems are continuously monitored by intrusion detection and prevention solutions. We strictly comply with security standards such as GDPR and CCPA. Regular backups are performed to ensure data recovery in case of loss. We conduct regular audits to improve our protocols.",
    "home-question-section-question-11": "Is Flunter 'GDPR compliant' and how is data managed?",
    "home-question-section-answer-11": "Yes, Flunter is compliant, and that's precisely why choosing Flunter to replace your usual tools is beneficial. Flunter strictly adheres to all GDPR and CCPA guidelines and standards for data access, processing, and storage, ensuring its compliance with these regulations. We have implemented a clear and effective right-to-forget policy allowing users to easily manage their personal data. All transmitted and stored data is secured with end-to-end encryption, ensuring protection against unauthorized interception. Additionally, our systems are subject to regular audits and tests to identify and correct any potential vulnerabilities, ensuring continuous and optimal protection.",
